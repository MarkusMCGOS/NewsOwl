            With Donald Trump becoming the 47th president of the United States, many Americans are now wondering what the future of the U.S. may look like. Following this article will lead you to all those possible paths Trump could lead America into.
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Short Term Impact</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Trump's choice on tariffs will impact many Americans greatly. Tariffs in the short term, could impact mostly Americans. How it would impact Americans is that a tariff, in simplest terms, is a tax on imported goods. The tariff will increase the cost of those goods, making them more expensive to purchase. As is well known, more prices is equal to more money spent for the same quantity of the same good. Since the consumer would be spending more money for the same good, the consumer would, as expected, buy less of the good. 
        </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Imagine this, BK IndU.S.tries is selling a 100g chocolate bar for 100 dollars. The industry produces all their chocolate bars in Canada. This means that they have to import the chocolate bars into the U.S. if they want to sell there. If Trump creates a 25% tariff for Canada, that means that BK Industries would have to sell their products for at least 25% more money to earn a profit. All the extra 25% tariffs would go to the government, but not the people that bought the chocolate bars. If the chocolate bar was 100 dollars before the tariff, the chocolate bar would be 125 dollars after the tariffs. That would mean consumers spending 25 more dollars than before. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Tariffs are very controversial, because they take extra money from consumers and give more money to the government. Back to the scenario, since BK Industries would be selling their chocolate bar for 125 dollars, that would mean that less people would be able to afford to buy it. BK Industries would have to close some stores since less people would be able to afford to buy their chocolate bars. BK Industries would only be able to keep stores in more rich cities since in middle-class cities people wouldn't be able to afford the chocolate bars. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            In the short run, tariffs sound like a bad idea. What about in the long run?
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Before reading about tariffs in the long run, you will read about gun rights. Gun rights have been a topic of great debate this election and now that Trump is in power, many people are wondering what will happen.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Trump campaigned heavily that immigrants were dangerous during his campaign. That message Trump said impacted his voters a lot because he said that immigrants were dangerous. Then people would want to defend themselves, most people would want to defend themselves with guns (the most safe way). 
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Trump wants to lift most gun restrictions that the Democrats made. The impact this could have is that if people jU.S.t go out on the street and see a man holding a rifle, that might be traumatizing. Trump strongly supports allowing rifles to be used, while the Democrats don’t. Since Trump supports the idea of a person being able to hold or use a rifle, some kids might be traumatized. Other kids might like the idea of the freedom to have a rifle and therefore support it when they become adults.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            What happens in the long run though?
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Long Term Impact</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Trump really likes tariffs. In a conversation in Chicago with a Bloomberg editor, he said that “tariff” is his favourite word. In many of his speeches, he has claimed to put high tariffs on imports from other countries. But why does Trump resort to tariffs so much?
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Trump's strong dislike for immigration has impacted the election a lot. Firstly, Trump has promised a lot that he would create the largest deportation in history., America is going through a phase where there is a high unemployment rate. Trump has claimed that the problem of unemployment is the immigrants coming from other countries. Since immigrants have to work somewhere, Trump blame them for taking the jobs from American people. Trump has had a very big impact with what he said; the unemployment rates have certainly impacted the choice for which candidate to vote for many voters.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            At the Economic Club of Chicago, he has claimed that there are many factories and mills which are “falling down”. He also claimed that he will lower taxes for those companies which produce things in the U.S. This shows that in his mind, he believes that putting high tariffs on other countries will protect American companies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Although this might seem like a disaster for the U.S., as claimed in the short term section above, this can actually benefit the U.S. in some ways. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            If prices for products from foreign nations are extremely high, then it might encourage people to start purchasing locally produced products. In return, the local company can expand and compete on the global scale. Then, the entire U.S. economy would grow.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            However, there are many more negative impacts for having high tariffs. Nations that you impose tariffs on will usually retaliate. For example, Trump recently threatened to impose a 10% additional tariff to China, putting it at around 40%. In retaliation, China claims to limit more sales of rare minerals to the U.S. If the U.S. keeps going on like this, it could mean losing access to necessary/vital minerals or resources.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Gun rights is another important though controversial topic when it comes to the aftermath of the election. Having the right to bear arms is stated in the 2nd amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as its purpose is to allow citizens to feel safe. However, that might slowly change in the long term.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            The longer someone owns a firearm, the likelier a gun related incident occurs. For example, if an adult is not responsible with where they put their weapons, like keeping a gun loaded and leaving it on the floor, accidents can happen. In 2022, a 4-year-old toddler accidentally ended a sibling’s life after finding a loaded gun. Things like this can happen the longer you own a weapon.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            Guns are like a double-edged sword. They can help you feel and stay safe and preserve your rights, but they can also be dangerous. For example, all civilian owned guns in the U.S. account for 46% of all civilian-held firearms in the world! That’s also approximately 120 guns per 100 people in the U.S.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold ml-8">
            However, there still is a possible compromise between banning civilian owned guns and preserving rights. New technology that is being developed will help greatly in the long term. For example, the Biofire Smart Gun is built so that only authorized users can shoot it, preventing gun accidents. There are also special types of technology that are being developed to try and prevent mass shootings. Things like tracking where you are and determining if you are in a “gun-free zone.”
          </p>
