            When watching the U.S. election, you need to understand what electoral college votes are as they determine the winner of the election. This Explainer article by NewsOwl will explain it all for you. Let's start with how electoral votes are calculated, per-state.
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">House of Representatives</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            Imagine Washington state. Washington awards 12 points for the candidate that gets a majority vote in the state. The state of Washington is divided into 10 congressional districts. When it comes to Election Day, people living in those districts come out to vote for a Representative. The elected Representative by the people then goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives, informally known as the House, is where all these Representatives, elected by the people in the district they represent, meet to vote on laws. Every 10 years, there is a Consensus; the Consensus is when the government counts the population of areas in the US. After the Consensus, the government changes the borders of congressional districts, or splits and merges some congressional districts based on the population of the area.
What you need to know is that a state's electoral college votes are defined by the number of congressional districts +2 (senators).

          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Districts into Votes</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            A candidate must win <span class="font-bold underline">at least</span> 270 electoral college votes to win a presidential election. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes.

          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2024 Presidential Election</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            The fact is that every election there are many key states: also known as swing states. Those states are usually the deciding “win” factors for a candidate in the election. In the 2024 election, the swing states were Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. Trump managed to win all 7 of them. <a href="this-is-why-trump-won-the-2024-us-election.html" class="text-blue-700 underline hover:text-blue-800">
              See our Opinion article on why.
            </a>
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            A state is nominated as a key state if polling has shown that neither candidate has a large advantage over the other.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            Every election, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes, and many key states are crucial to a candidate’s win. This election, Trump needed to win North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. If Trump got all the battleground states but didn’t get any of these 3 states, he would not have won. Those states are classical examples of key states in elections. 
          </p>
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Importance</h1>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
            Why is learning about the electoral college votes important? Learning about electoral college votes is a really important thing in life. Especially for North Americans, all countries in North America trade a lot with each other and have tight economical relationships. Therefore, since the U.S. election impacts who’s in power, depending on who is in power. That person in power might do something you wish didn’t happen.  For example, tariffs. Many people don’t support tariffs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
Learning about electoral college votes can help you track how the election is going, which can help you understand it all. Understanding how someone got what you didn’t want them to get is essential to life. Especially in the election, now that Trump has won, some Democrats might be wondering how he won. If you don’t understand something, you are more likely to deny it, that is what a person does; and that’s why you have to seek understanding.
